# Airbnb Clone — Backend Features & Functionalities

---

## 1. Project Overview

This document lists the backend features and functionalities required to build a scalable, secure, and maintainable Airbnb Clone REST API. It translates the project requirements into a developer-facing blueprint that can be used to implement the system and to produce diagrams in Draw.io.

**Scope:** server-side APIs, data model, core integrations (auth, payments, file storage), admin controls, and non-functional expectations (security, scalability, testing).

## 2. Core Modules & Functionalities

Each module below lists the features, short descriptions, likely endpoints and the primary actors involved.

### A. Authentication & Authorization

**Features**

* User registration (Guest / Host / Admin)
* Login with email/password
* OAuth login (Google, Facebook) — optional
* JWT-based access tokens and refresh tokens
* Password hashing (bcrypt) and reset flows
* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Example endpoints**

* `POST /api/v1/auth/register`

* Pagination and sorting
* Caching (Redis) for common queries

**Endpoint**

* `GET /api/v1/search` or `GET /api/v1/listings?q=...` with query params

**Actors:** Guest, Host

### E. Booking & Reservation System

**Features**

* Create bookings with date validation and double-booking protection
* Booking workflows: pending → confirmed → completed → cancelled → refunded
* Host approval (for non-instant bookings) or instant-booking modes
* Cancellation policies and penalties
* Booking history for guest and host

**Endpoints**

* `POST /api/v1/bookings`
* `GET /api/v1/bookings/{id}`

**Actors:** Guest, Host, Admin

### F. Payment Integration

**Features**

* Integrate Stripe (recommended) or PayPal for payments
* Create PaymentIntent and confirm payment client-side
* Secure webhook handling for payment events
* Refunds and payout scheduling to hosts
* Support for multiple currencies and exchange handling

**Endpoints**

* `POST /api/v1/payments/create-intent`
* `GET /api/v1/payments/{id}`
* `POST /webhooks/stripe`

**Actors:** Guest, Host, Admin

### G. Reviews & Ratings

**Features**

* Guests leave review & rating linked to a completed booking
* Hosts can reply to reviews
* Aggregated rating per listing and host

**Endpoints**

* `POST /api/v1/listings/{id}/reviews`
* `GET /api/v1/listings/{id}/reviews`

**Actors:** Guest, Host

### H. Notifications

**Features**

* Email and in-app notifications for booking events, payments, cancellations
* Use SendGrid/Mailgun for email
* Push notifications (optional) using a notification service

**Endpoints**

* internal event-driven notifications — no direct public endpoints

**Actors:** Guest, Host, Admin

### I. Admin Dashboard & Moderation

**Features**

* List & manage users, listings, bookings, payments
* Content moderation tools (flagging, takedown)
* Generate reports: revenue, occupancy, active listings

**Endpoints**

* `GET /api/v1/admin/stats`
* `PUT /api/v1/admin/listings/{id}/moderate`

**Actors:** Admin

## 3. Data Model (High-level)

Suggested using PostgreSQL. Store monetary values as integer (cents) to avoid float issues.

**Key tables (summary)**

* `users` — id (UUID), name, email, password_hash, role, phone, photo_url, created_at
* `listings` — id, host_id, title, description, address (json), lat, lng, price_cents, max_guests, amenities (json[]), photos (json[]), is_published, created_at
* `availability` — id, listing_id, date_from, date_to, type
* `bookings` — id, listing_id, guest_id, host_id, start_date, end_date, nights, total_cents, currency, status, payment_id, created_at
* `payments` — id, booking_id, provider, provider_charge_id, amount_cents, currency, status, metadata (json), created_at
* `reviews` — id, listing_id, user_id, booking_id, rating, text, created_at

**Indexes & constraints**

* Unique constraint on `users.email`
* Index on `listings(lat, lng)` for geo queries (PostGIS optional)
* Booking date overlap constraint enforced at application level with transactions or table locks

## 4. API Design Notes (Validation & Edge Cases)

* Validate booking date ranges and enforce availability with DB transaction + row locking to prevent race conditions.
* Store currency and locale on payments and bookings for correct display.
* Rate-limit authentication endpoints and search endpoints.
* Return consistent error shapes (RFC 7807 Problem Details or similar).

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements (how backend will meet them)

* **Scalability:** modular architecture, containerization (Docker), horizontal scaling, Redis for caching.
* **Security:** hashed passwords (bcrypt), TLS-only, secure JWT handling, store secrets in env vault, input validation and sanitization.
* **Performance:** DB indices, pagination, background jobs for heavy work (image processing, notifications).
* **Testing:** unit tests and integration tests for API endpoints; automated API tests.

## 6. Draw.io Diagram — recommended layout & content

Create a single-page diagram named `airbnb_features.drawio` and export to `airbnb_features.png`.

**Diagram elements (boxes):**

* Users (Guest, Host, Admin)
* Auth Service
* User Service
* Listings Service
* Search Service
* Availability / Booking Service
* Payments Service (Stripe)
* Reviews Service
* Notifications Service
* File Storage (S3/Cloudinary)
* Database (Postgres)

**Connections (arrows):**

* Users → Auth Service (register/login)
* Auth Service → User Service (profile management)
* Host → Listings Service (create/update)
* Guest → Search Service → Listings Service (view)
* Guest → Booking Service → Payments Service
* Payments Service → Webhooks → Booking Service (update status)
* Booking Service → Reviews Service (after completed)
* Services → Database (Postgres)
* Listings Service → File Storage (photo uploads)
* Notifications Service subscribes to Booking and Payment events

**Annotations to add near arrows:**

* List main endpoints (e.g., `POST /api/v1/bookings`) for the major flows
* Mark which flows require authentication and RBAC
* Note where transactions/locks are required (booking creation)

## 7. Export & Commit Instructions

1. Open Draw.io ([https://app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net))
2. Create a new diagram using the layout above.
3. Save/export as PNG: File → Export → PNG (check "Include a copy of my diagram" and set DPI to 150)
4. Name the file `airbnb_features.png` and place it in `features-and-functionalities/` in your repo.

**Git commands** (run from repo root):

```bash
mkdir -p features-and-functionalities
# copy airbnb_features.png into that directory
# create README.md with this content
git add features-and-functionalities/README.md features-and-functionalities/airbnb_features.png
git commit -m "task0: document backend features and add Draw.io diagram"
git push origin main
```

## 8. Checklist for submission

* [ ] `features-and-functionalities/README.md` present
* [ ] `features-and-functionalities/airbnb_features.png` present
* [ ] Files committed and pushed to `alx-airbnb-project-documentation` GitHub repo

---

If you want, I can now:

* generate a ready-to-paste `README.md` (this file is already formatted for that),
* create an **OpenAPI YAML skeleton** for the main endpoints,
* generate SQL `CREATE TABLE` statements for PostgreSQL,
* or produce a Draw.io XML export (if you want the exact diagram XML you can import into Draw.io).

Tell me which of the above you'd like next and I will produce it.
